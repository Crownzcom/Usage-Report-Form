Actions - {action_id, date_time, comment_id, user_id, action, comment, status}

Below are the sheets with their column header names in the google sheet:
Categories - {category_id, name, url, cover_img}
Comments - {comment_id, user_id, category_id, topic_id, slide_name, date, comment}
Users - {user_id, user_name, email_address}
Topics - {topic_id, category_id, name, url}

Create a Google Apps Script (GAS) Request that will contain;
{user_email, category_id, topic_id, slide_name, comment}

The GAS code will: 
user_email: retrieves all the data from the 'Users' sheet, iterates through the rows to find a match for the email address provided in the request data, and extracts the user ID associated with that email, which is saved as the user ID in the comments sheet.

If the user exists, we proceed with the below and saving them to their respective columns in the 'Comments' sheet.
category_id:saved directly to the 'Comments' sheet

topic_id: saved directly to the 'Comments' sheet

slide_name: saved directly to the 'Comments' sheet

comment: saved directly to the 'Comments' sheet

The columns below in the 'Comments' sheet are autogenerated upon receiving data:
comment_id: determines the next comment ID by checking the last row of the 'Comments' sheet. If the sheet is empty or the first row contains a header instead of a number, it sets the comment ID to 1. Otherwise, it increments the last comment ID found in the sheet.
date: this is appends the current date.

After resolving all the above It then appends a new row to the 'Comments' sheet with the new comment ID, user ID, category ID, topic ID, slide name, current date, and comment from the request data.
